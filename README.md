# Obesity Risk Prediction (Classification|LGBM|Visual EDA)
## Goal
The goal of this project is to use various factors to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease.
## About the Dataset
The data consist of the estimation of obesity levels in people from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, with ages between 14 and 61 and diverse eating habits and physical condition , data was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Obesity or CVD risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster).

The attributes related with eating habits are: Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC), Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC), Number of main meals (NCP), Consumption of food between meals (CAEC), Consumption of water daily (CH20), and Consumption of alcohol (CALC). The attributes related with the physical condition are: Calories consumption monitoring (SCC), Physical activity frequency (FAF), Time using technology devices (TUE), Transportation used (MTRANS)
variables obtained :
Gender, Age, Height and Weight.

NObesity values are:

•Underweight Less than 18.5<br />
•Normal 18.5 to 24.9<br />
•Overweight 25.0 to 29.9<br />
•Obesity I 30.0 to 34.9<br />
•Obesity II 35.0 to 39.9<br />
•Obesity III Higher than 40<br />
